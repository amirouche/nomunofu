### Abstract

A core set of procedures for creating and manipulating heterogeneous
multidimensional arrays is proposed. The design is consistent with the
rest of Scheme and independent of other container data types. It
provides easy sharing of parts of an array as other arrays without
copying, encouraging a declarative style of programming.
