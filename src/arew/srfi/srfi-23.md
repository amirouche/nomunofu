This is based on [SRFI-23](https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-23/).

### Abstract

A mechanism is proposed to allow Scheme code to report errors and
abort execution. The proposed mechanism is already implemented in
several Scheme systems and can be implemented, albeit imperfectly, in
any R5RS conforming Scheme.

### Reference

#### `(error <reason> [arg ...])`
