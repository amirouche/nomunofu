### Abstract

When programming in functional style, it is frequently necessary to
specialize some of the parameters of a multi-parameter procedure. For
example, from the binary operation cons one might want to obtain the
unary operation (lambda (x) (cons 1 x)). This specialization of
parameters is also known as "partial application", "operator section"
or "projection".
