### Abstract

The named-`let` incarnation of the `let` form has two slight
inconsistencies with the `define` form. As defined, the `let` form
makes no accommodation for rest arguments, an issue of functionality
and consistency. As defined, the let form does not accommodate
signature-style syntax, an issue of aesthetics and consistency. Both
issues are addressed here in a manner which is compatible with the
traditional `let` form but for minor extensions.
